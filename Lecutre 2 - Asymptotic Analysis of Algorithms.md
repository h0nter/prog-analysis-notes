# Lecutre 2 - Asymptotic Analysis of Algorithms
### Experimental Study
1. Implementat algorithm
2. Choose appropriate inputs
3. Run program on all inputs
4. Plot results
5. Determine reate at which time increases

**Pros:**
- Realistic impression of actual time
- Useful when comparing 2 candidate algorithms
- Subtle differences in running time emerge
- Useful when hardware, software and inputs can be established

**Cons:**
- Time consuming to implement
- Time consuming to run on large inputs
- Needs good understanding of the context in which algorithm is deployed
- Comparable implementations required to compare algorithms

### Asymptotic Analysis
- Looks at how running time increasses as input size grows
  - rather rough classification of the rate of growth
  - concerned with the long term growth rate
- Running time as a mathematical function
  - problem size - *n*
  - running time of algorithm - *t(n)*

**Cons:**
- Measures running time in terms of number of "steps"
- Size of a single step doesn't matter

**Determining bounds:**
- Upper bound O(.)
- Lower bound ùõÄ(.)
- Tight bound ùöπ(.)
